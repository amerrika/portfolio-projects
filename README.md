# Portfolio of my selected projects
I have selected these projects to showcase my current skill set and knowledge of Web development. When I started with my Frontend journey my main focus was learning and practicing HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (DOM). I am familiar with Sass and love using it in my personal projects. The very first JavaScript framework I have started learning has been Astro and I find it great for beginners and for building static websites. Right now I am spending most of my time learning Vue.js.
