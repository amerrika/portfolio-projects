# Portfolio of my selected projects
I have selected these projects to showcase my current skill set and knowledge of Web development. When I started with my Frontend journey my main focus was learning and practicing **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **JavaScript**. I am familiar with **Sass** and love using it in my personal projects. When I'm building landing page projects I'm trying to learn about **Web Accessibility** and to implement it in my projects.

The very first JavaScript framework I have started learning has been **Astro** and I find it great for beginners and for building static websites. With Astro I came across many concepts such as components, props, SSG (Static Site Generator), SSR (Server Side Rendering), routing etc. Right now I am spending most of my time learning **Vue.js**. 

I have also started learning Node.js/Express/MongoDB with the goal to keep improving my understanding of Web Development and eventually to create an app that communicates with database.
